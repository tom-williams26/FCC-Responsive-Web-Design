        <h2>COVID-19 2020</h2>
        <p>
          This year has been the most challenging in NHS history, with staff 
          displaying extraordinary dedication, skill and compassion to care for 
          the 100,000 patients with COVID-19 who needed specialist hospital 
          treatment and many others besides.<p>
          <p>During this testing time our nurses, doctors, physios, pharmacists 
          and countless more colleagues were sustained by the support of the public, 
          not least through the weekly applause for key workers.</p> 
          <p>No health service, not even the NHS, could have coped 
          alone with this coronavirus pandemic.</p>
          <p>From bus drivers and teachers to care staff and food retailers and, 
          of course, the public who took action to stay at home to stop infection 
          spreading, everyone played their part.</p> 
          <p>The NHSâ€™s birthday this year not only offers the opportunity for us 
          to say thank you to the nation, but for us all to come together at 5pm to  
          pause and recognise all the work which has taken place in the last 
          months and say a heartfelt thank you.</p>

        <h3>Timeline of the NHS</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            1948 - Creation of the NHS
            <p>
              On 5 July, Health Secretary Aneurin Bevan formally launched the
              NHS. For the first time, health care became free to all.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            1958 - First mass vaccination programme

            <p>
              Polio and diphtheria jabs offered to under 15s. Before
              introduction, there were 8,000 cases of polio and 70,000 of
              diphtheria each year.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            1961 - Pill becomes available

            <p>
              launch of the contraceptive pill gives women control over how many
              children they have. Initially, it was only available to married
              couples, but the rules were relaxed six years later with the
              swinging sixties in full flow.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            1962 - Birth of the modern hospital

            <p>
              The Hospital Plan, put forward by Health Minister Enoch Powell,
              set out a 10-year vision for hospital building. Every population
              of 125,000 was to get a hospital - or district general hospital as
              they become known.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            1967 - Abortion Act
            <p>
              Introduced by Liberal MP David Steel and passed by a free vote of
              MPs, it made abortion legal up to 28 weeks if a woman's mental or
              physical health was at risk. Limit reduced to 24 weeks in 1990.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            1968 - UK's first heart transplant
            <p>
              Carried out in the National Heart Hospital in London, 18 doctors
              and nurses operated for seven hours on a 45-year-old man. The
              patient died after 46 days and another 10 years passed before the
              operation took off.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            1972 - CT scanners used for first time
            <p>
              Under development for the previous five years, CT scanners started
              to be used on patients. The machines take pictures of the body to
              develop 3D images, revolutionising investigations of the body.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            1978 - World's first test tube baby
            <p>
              On 25 July, the world's first "test tube baby" was born shortly
              before midnight in Oldham District General Hospital. Weighing 5lb
              12oz (2.61 kg), Louise Brown was delivered by caesarean section.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            1988 - Breast screening programme starts
            <p>
              To reduce breast cancer deaths in women over 50, breast screening
              was introdcued with units set up across the country to provide
              mammograms to women. Screening, along with improved drug
              treatments, was estimated to have cut deaths by a fifth.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            1990 - NHS and Community Care Act
            <p>
              The legislation introduces what became known as the NHS internal
              market with health authorities given their own budgets to buy care
              for local populations from hospitals.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            1994 - Organ donor register created
            <p>
              NHS register set up to co-ordinate supply and demand. It was the
              result of a five-year campaign by John and Rosemary Cox whose son
              Peter died in 1989. He had asked for his organs to be used to help
              others.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            2006 - Patient choice
            <p>
              Patients were given the choice of four or five hospitals, ending
              the long-held tradition of going where a GPs decides. The scheme
              has now been extended to include all hospitals in England. But
              approach not adopted elsewhere in the UK.
