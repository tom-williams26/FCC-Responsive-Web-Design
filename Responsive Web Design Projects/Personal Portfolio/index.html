                    <h1>About me</h1>
                    <div class="background-container">
                        <div>
                            <p>Throughout my university experience I was introduced to a range of modules that covers many programming languages. Initially, I was concerned about my ability to deliver due to my lack of experience with programming.
                            </p>
                            <p>Progressing through each academic year, I gained experience building GUIs using C# (.NET), Java (Android) & Swift (IOS) and some exposure to APIs</p>
                            <p>Other modules included Object-oriented programming with C++ and building Design Patterns in Python.
                            </p>
                            <p>In my Final year of study, One of my modules were to collabrate within a team and contribute towards the project of choice</p>
                            <p>We decided it was of best interest to apply common industry methodologies and tools like the Agile methodology and Kanban to promote weekly sprints and keeping track of allocated tickets, this allowed the team to develop a
                                working product from the beginning.</p>
                            <p>Communication was a cruical asset to the team espically when COVID-19 began, we were no longer able to attend meetings in our allocated workshop at university instead we had to resort to using skype for video calls and working
                                remotely from home.</p>
                            <p>
                                Towards the end of my Intergrated Masters at univeristy, I have continously been conducting research and read how others have made their way into the tech industry, This involved attending local events and engaging with the community organised through
                                the "Meetup" app. Other means of research was through the use of browsing the web and being inspired by the journeys other people have undertaken through the use of Medium, Reddit & youtube.
                            </p>
                            <p>I am a strong believer in reinforced learning, throughout my univeristy experience I had very little exposure to web development and decided to take an invaluable online course with FreeCodeCamp which I am thoroughly enjoying.
                                Upon completion of this course I believe I will hold the skills and experience to land a job and apply my knowledge to real-world projects.</p>

                        </div>

                        <!-- <p>In 2015, I decided to further my education and take a course in Information Technology. My passion for technology was rapidly growing and was eager to learn more about the subject. With the support from my lecturers, I was able to
                        achieve exceptionally well in my grades which set me up nicely when applying to universities.
                    </p>
                    <p>Shortly after starting university, I quickly discovered what was expected from me. There was multiple occasions where I found myself overwhelmed from the course content and there was several times I wanted to drop out of university,
                        but I persevered and unofficially graduated (COVID-19) with a Upper Second-Class Honours.</p>
